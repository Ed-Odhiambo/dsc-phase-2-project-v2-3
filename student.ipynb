    ">> ### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this project, the task is to undertake research on property market in King County and to determine the major factors for the houses within the neighbourhoods for a real estate agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The objective of this project is to utilize multiple linear regression modeling to evaluate house sales data in King County Washington, USA. The aim is to gain insights and make predictions about the factors that affect house sales in the area as well as lucrative neighbourhoods to invest in while using statistical techniques to support relevant recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remodeling certain areas of a property is an excellent way for homeowners to add increased functionality and beauty to a property at someone else's expense. By choosing the right project to enhance your living space, a significant portion of the expense can be passed on to future owners in the form of increased property values\n"

    "\n",
    "The real estate agency needs to provide advice to homeowners regarding how home renovations can potentially increase the estimated value of their properties and homes and by what amount. This information will assist the real estate agency in advising their clients about how to make informed decisions regarding home renovations, and in turn, assist homeowners in maximizing the return on their investment when selling their properties.\n"

    "\n",
    "* We will focus on analysing house sales in a northwestern county for a possible stakeholder, a real estate agency helping homeowners buy and/or sell homes. Specifically, we will address the business problem of providing homeowners advice on how home renovations can increase the estimated value of their homes and by what amount.\n",

    "* This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in \"kc_house_data.csv\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the challenges that may arise in this project is the incomplete or ambiguous description of the column names in the dataset. However, with thorough research or good judgment, we can understand the data and make informed decisions on which variables to use in our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Another challenge is ensuring that the linear regression model we develop adds value to our analysis, rather than simply fulfilling the project's requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset includes information on house sales in King County such as the prices, the design, the size in square footages, the location etc. Others can be found at ['Property Schema'](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-phase-2-project-v2-3/blob/main/data/column_names.md)\n"

    "\n",
    "* To determine the increase in prices of property due to renovations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To define a clear stakeholder and business problem that relates to the King County House Sales dataset, and to use this problem to guide the analysis and modelling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To build and evaluate multiple linear regression models using various combinations of the available features in the dataset, with the aim of identifying the most relevant and impactful features for predicting house sale prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To use appropriate statistical techniques to refine and optimize the regression models, and to clearly explain the rationale behind each technique used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To demonstrate an iterative approach to modelling, documenting each stage of the process and providing justification for each model modification .\n",
    "\n",
    "* To provide a final documentation that includes a detailed analysis of the chosen model, including relevant metrics describing overall model performance and the coefficients of the most impactful features, and a clear explanation of how the model adds value to the stakeholder and the appropriate recommendations."
